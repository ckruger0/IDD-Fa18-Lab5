## Electronics

```
// Useless Box Lab 5
//
// If we see a voltage change on pin 2 the toggle switch on top of the useless box has 
// changed position and we need to react!
//    A HIGH value on pin 2 means we should activate the servo to open the useless 
//    box and attempt to return the switch to the "off" position.
//    A LOW value on pin 2 means the switch is off and we should return to our 
//    inital (closed box) state.

#include <Servo.h> 

#define servoPin  10
#define switchPin 2

#define closePos  0
#define openPos   180

Servo servo;
int switchState;
int previousSwitchState;

// call this when the input on pin 2 changes (LOW to HIGH *or* HIGH to LOW)
void ToggleSwitch(int switchState)
{    
  if (switchState == HIGH)
  {
    servo.write(openPos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is HIGH.  servo.write(openPos) called to open useless box");
  }
  else
  {
    servo.write(closePos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is LOW.   servo.write(closePos) called to close useless box");
  }
  previousSwitchState = switchState;  // remember that the switch state has changed 
}

void setup()
{
  //Serial.begin(9600);
  //Serial.println("Useless Box Lab 5");

  // start with the box closed and the switch in the off postion
  switchState = LOW;
  previousSwitchState = LOW;

  // connect to our servo and make sure it is in the closed position
  servo.attach(servoPin);
  servo.write(closePos);

  // we should probably pay attention to the switch
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); 
}

void loop()
{ 
  int switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  if (switchState != previousSwitchState)
    ToggleSwitch(switchState);

## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.
1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.
1. At least one photo of your useless box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).
1. A video of your useless box in action.
